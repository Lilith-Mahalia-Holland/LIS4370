Description: This package is currently a viterbi preprocessing tool that is
    intended to primarly clean data for NLP word. The tool corrects misspelt and
    fussed words in corrupted text by training a dictionary and comparing word
    probability to said dictionary. The algorithm is not perfect but can be
    quite powerful when used in the right circumstances.
